# HOPE-International-YouVersion

During my 2017 summer internship at HOPE International, I was tasked with creating a landing page that would link to a variety of our YouVersion Bible Study Plans.

With this project, I utlized a lot of our website templates to frame the basis of the landing page. The more tricker aspect of this page was to figure out how should I display/advertise the variety of Bible Study plan. My solution was to utilize the bootstrap column framework to best showcase the individual Bible Study plans. Another tricky aspect of this project was to make it responsive to different window sizes. I had to do some research with Bootstrap and HTML media query.
